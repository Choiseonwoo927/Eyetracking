# Eyetracking_experiment
## Introduce
department of Psychology, Gachon university

we interested to the Visual Working Memory(VWM) using Eyetracking tools.   
so, we studied **The Effect of Picture- Word Stimulus Location and Congruency on Visual Working Memory**

we used Eyetracking tools for recording the eye movement data, **WebGazer**.
Webgazer is open-source software using Javascript code in your web environment.

## Experiments
- experiment 1: Experiment on the Interaction Effect of Congruent/Incongruent Judgment by Stimulus Location
- experiment 2: Experiment on the Memory recognition rate by Stimulus Location

## Conditions

1. `experiment.html`: it is a script by the CSS and javascript. so if you want to try our experiment, it download this file and run it.
2. `stimuli`: it is our all both image and word stimuli file.
3. `conditions`: it is our conditions of the experiment 1. -> congruent, incongruent, same_congruent, same_incongruent
   3-1. `total_cond.json`: it is our total stimuli file that include each stimulus github urls.
4. `conditions2`: it is same to the `conditions`, but about the experiment 2 -> congruent, incongruent, nonebefore
   4-1. `total_cond2.json`: it is same to the `total_cond.json`, but about the experiment 2.
5. `practice_cond`: it is practice stimuli by the conditions. -> same to the `conditions`
   5-1. `practice_total.json`: it is same to the `total_cond.json`, but about the practice trial.
